To install: 
- in your development directory clone the root installation maintained by ERI team: 
git clone git@repository.unesco.org:org_unesco_iwp_www_projects.git 
- in your development directory clone your project installation: git clone git@repository.unesco.org:your_project_name.git 
- cd org_unesco_iwp_www_projects.git/src/sites/ 
- ln -s path_to/your_project_name . 
- create an empty database locally. 

-- in mysql: create database drupal_yourprojectname_local; 

- import the data from the initial installation. 

-- in mysql: mysql -u youruser -p drupal_yourprojectname_local < dump_yourproject.sql 

it is done! now check your settings.php and apache.conf. 

a good starting point are the examples you can find here as settings.php.example and apache.conf.example. 

If you open http://localhost in your broser you will be able to see your website! 

Guidelines: 
- use your local machine for development and the stage to test content. 
- once you upload some code in stage, means it is ready for production!!! be carufull!
