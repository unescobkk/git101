VERSION INFO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently this module use only free Flexpaper 2.1.2 version. So, all pdfs are
shown only in flash mode. In this mode Flexpaper take the swf file(s) generated
from the pdf. Flexpaper module provides generating of swf files using pdf2swf
converter which is part of Swftools utilities collection (see the installation
guide).

Document can be loaded in two ways: as one swf file per whole pdf file and as
one swf file per the document page (see formatter settings). To provide correct
way to search the text in the split mode, Flexpaper takes json file generated by
pdf2json tool (see the installation guide).

there is no html and html5 modes. Also, all features of Adaptive UI is not

like. But despite of it, Flexpaper support json files here.
